                        The European languages are members of the same family.
                        Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music,
                        sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The
                        languages only differ in their grammar, their
                        pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone
                        realizes why a new common language would be desirable:
                        one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To
                        achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform
                        grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several
                        languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting
                        language is more simple and regular than that of the
                        individual languages. The new common language will be
                        more simple and regular than the existing European
                        languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact,
                        it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will
                        seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge
                        friend of mine told me what Occidental is.The European
                        languages are members of the same family. Their separate
                        existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc,
